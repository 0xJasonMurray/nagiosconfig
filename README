Overview
========
Script used to generate Nagios host and service definitions.  A single configuration
file with the host{} and service{} definitions should be created for each device to 
be monitored (see example usage below).   Nagios should be configured to read all 
configuration files within a directory(s).

Philosophy
==========
The idea behind this system is to create individal configuration files for
each device to be monitored.  This system is going to create independent
service checks for EACH host.   This may DUPLICATE lots of service checks.

Why do this?   The mains goals are:

    * Flexability: If you need the ability tweak settings for each device.
    * Simplicity: It makes it easy for everyone to understand.

DON'T use this system if... If you have many device that could all share 
a common set of configuration parameters and you don't mind a system that 
is more complex to initially setup.  I would suggest looking into Nagios 
Object Inheritance and Template-Based Object Configuration.


Example Usage
=============
$ ./nagiosconfig.py --hostname test1.example.com --ipaddr 1.2.3.4 --createhost \
        --parents switch1.example.com --parents switch2.example.com \
        --hostgroup server --hostgroup nss --hostgroup dns --device server \
        --parents switch2.example.com --service ping --service ssh \
        --device server --regexchange contact_groups:user@example.com > test1.cfg


Additional Notes
================
* The --service option is dynamically built based on the service definition template files.
* The --hostgroups are dynamically built based on the standard Nagios hostgroup.cfg configuration file.
